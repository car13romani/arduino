# Cayenne SendData Example

This example sketch shows how a value can be sent from Arduino to the Cayenne Dashboard on a Virtual Pin.

The Cayenne Library is required to run this sketch. If you have not already done so you can install it from the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

###### Steps:
1. Create a Generic Analog Input widget attached to Virtual Pin 5 in the Cayenne Dashboard.
2. Set the token variable to match the Arduino token from the Dashboard.
3. Compile and upload the sketch.

###### NOTE:
 For this example you'll need SimpleTimer library:
